# HTTP-requests-in-Javascript-code-snippets-from-Codecademy

This repository contains some useful code snippets of a Javascript free course available on Codecademy.

I would highly suggest to check out that course.

Based on my personal experience, you will be loving to learn Javascript as a newbie from that website. 

For HTTP requests section, I have made it simple for you all to just go through this folder right above.And use them in your projects after making changes you want. Thank you.
